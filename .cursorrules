- We are building a "Living Being" architecture for PTD Fitness.

- Always check 'WIRING_ANALYSIS.md' before writing new code.

- Every time you create a new database table, you MUST update the 'introspect_schema_verbose' SQL function in Supabase so the agent can see it.

- When generating UI, use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn.

- Never hardcode client data; always use the 'client_control' tool to fetch it.
