## 1. The "Single Truth" Workflow
Stop checking multiple spreadsheets. Your dashboard is now the source of truth.

### A. If Data Looks Wrong
1.  Look at the top-right of your Dashboard.
2.  Click the **Sync Status** icon (Green Check or Yellow Alert).
3.  Click **"Full Sync (Historical)"**.
    *   *Why?* Sometimes HubSpot API limits prevent us from seeing old clients. This forces a deep scan of the last 5 years.
    *   *Wait Time:* ~5-10 minutes.

### B. "Is this client real?" (Phil Dunn Test)
1.  Go to the **Stripe Intelligence** page (`/stripe`).
2.  Ask the AI: *"Did Phil Dunn pay today?"*
3.  It will query the live Stripe ledger instantly. It does *not* rely on the database sync for this answer.

## 2. Key Modules & How to Use Them

| Module | URL | CEO Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Money Map** | `/money-map` | Check **ROAS** daily. If a campaign < 2.0x, kill it. If > 4.0x, scale it. |
| **War Room** | `/leaderboard` | Reward the "MVP" of the month. The points system is automated (Setters vs. Coaches). |
| **AI Advisor** | `/ai-advisor` | Before firing a client, generate a "Save Script" here. It uses 10+ data points to write the perfect text. |
| **Stripe AI** | `/stripe` | Ask: *"What is my exact revenue this week vs last week?"* |

## 3. The "Antigravity" Architecture
Your system is built to self-heal.

*   **Unified AI Client:** If your Claude credits run out, it *automatically* switches to OpenAI (GPT-4o) without crashing.
*   **Stripe Webhooks:** We patched the "Crypto" bug. Every payment is now recorded in real-time.
*   **Error Self-Correction:** If a sync fails, it logs to `sync_errors`. The `system-health-check` agent monitors this and retries.

## 4. Emergency Procedures

**Scenario: "The Dashboard is blank!"**
1.  Don't panic. It's usually a browser cache issue.
2.  Hard Refresh (Cmd+Shift+R).
3.  If still blank, open **Cursor**, switch to Agent Mode, and type: *"Check Vercel deployment status."*

**Scenario: "Webflow form didn't create a deal."**
1.  This is a Zapier/Integromat issue (external to this system).
2.  Check the **HubSpot Live** page (`/hubspot-live`). If it's not there, it never reached HubSpot.
