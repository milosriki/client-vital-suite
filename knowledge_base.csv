"Question","Answer"
"1. Men Over 40","""I understand. Most executives I work with feel the same—metabolism slows down after 40, and the old gym routine stops working. Our system is built for your schedule. We come to you, so you save that 90 mins of commute. Imagine having the energy to crush that 3pm meeting AND play with the kids at night. I have a slot Tuesday at 6am (before early calls). Would that help fit it into your day?"""
"2. Men Over 50","""At 50, it's about training smarter, not harder. The goal is to be active for decades. My team specializes in joint-friendly strength. No crazy jumping—just solid, science-based movement to bulletproof your back and knees. We could do a simple movement screen check first. It's safe and gives us a baseline. Would Thursday 10am work for a calm chat?"""
"3. Women Over 40","""I hear you. What worked in your 30s often stops working now because hormones change the game. We don't fight your body; we work with it. We focus on specific toning and metabolic signals that reignite fat loss without starving yourself. Ready to feel more like _you_ again? We could explore this on Tuesday?"""
"4. Women Over 50","""This is a new chapter! Strength training is actually the #1 method for bone density and vibrant energy during menopause. We start very gentle. We come to you, so you're in your own comfortable space. Let's just talk about your goals first. No pressure. Does a morning chat suit you?"""
"5. Moms","""Being a mom is the hardest job. You pour everything into them—this is about giving _you_ 45 mins to recharge so you can be an even better mom. We work around nap times. I can even come to the park with the stroller! Let's reclaim that confidence. Would Monday during nap time give you a moment?"""
"1. "Too Expensive"","""I completely understand that budget is a significant factor. It’s smart to be careful. Many of our happier clients felt the same way initially. But they found that reclaiming their energy and confidence made a huge difference in their daily lives—work, family, everything just got better. Since our initial assessment is complimentary, would you be open to just seeing the personalized plan first? No pressure at all—just so you can see if this approach resonates with you."""
"2. "No Time"","""I hear you, and honestly, I don't know how you do it all! That busy schedule is exactly why we designed our 'We Come to You' service. We want to give you time back, not take it away. By skipping the commute, you actually save about 6 hours a week. Can we try a small step? Let's just look at a 45-min slot where we come to you, just to see if it makes your life easier?"""
"3. "Need to Think"","""Of course! It's a big decision, and you should feel 100% comfortable. The assessment is designed purely to give you clarity—knowing your metabolic rate and movement patterns helps you make the _best_ decision for yourself, whether it's with us or not. Why don't we do the assessment just to get you that roadmap? Then you can take all the time you need to decide."""
"4. "I'll Start Later "","""That's a very practical approach. It makes sense to start when you can focus. What if we just did the 'Blueprint' phase now? That way, we can map out your perfect plan, and you'll have everything ready to go the moment you say 'Go'. It takes the stress off trying to figure it out later. Does finding a slot just for the planning phase sound helpful?"""
