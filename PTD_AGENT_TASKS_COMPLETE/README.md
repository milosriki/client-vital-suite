# PTD Agent Tasks - Complete Guide

This package contains 20 independent, safe tasks designed to upgrade your PTD Fitness system with robust error handling, automation, and intelligence.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Review the Plan**: Read `MASTER_ORCHESTRATION.md` to understand the 4-phase strategy.
2.  **Assign Tasks**: Distribute the `TASK_XX_*.md` files to your AI agents (or execute them yourself).
3.  **Execute in Order**: Follow the phases:
    *   **Phase 1 (Tasks 1-5)**: Database Foundation (Safe, SQL only)
    *   **Phase 2 (Tasks 6-10)**: Core Features (New Components & Functions)
    *   **Phase 3 (Tasks 11-15)**: Automation & Integration (Cron Jobs & Dashboard)
    *   **Phase 4 (Tasks 16-20)**: Testing & Verification

## 📂 Package Structure
