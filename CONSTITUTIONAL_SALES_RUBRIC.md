# Constitutional Sales Rubric: Call Quality & Intent DNA

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AI INSTRUCTION (GEMINI 3 FLASH)**: Use this rubric to calculate the `lead_intent_iq` (0-100) for every CallGear transcript. 
> Priority: **Commitment Language > Duration**.

## 1. The "Lead DNA" Scoring Weights
- **Sentiment & Tone (40%)**: Does the lead sound urgent? Do they use affirmative language ("I'm ready", "Let's do it")?
- **NEPQ Framework Match (40%)**: 
    - **Dominant Pain**: Did the coach uncover the *real* struggle?
    - **Binary Choice**: Did the setter offer "Mornings or Evenings?" or "Slot A or Slot B?"
- **Outcome Code (20%)**: Does the CallGear status match the transcript sentiment?

## 2. High-Intent Signals (Positive IQ)
- **Time Commitment**: "I will make time for this."
- **Financial Readiness**: Lead asks about next steps or "What's involved?" without aggressively blocking on price.
- **Problem Ownership**: Lead admits that "nothing changing in 6 months" is unacceptable.
- **Micro-Yes**: Affirmative responses to at least 3 discovery questions.

## 3. Low-Intent / Waste Signals (Negative IQ)
- **The "Thinker"**: "I need to think about it" without a specific follow-up time.
- **The "Price Hunter"**: Only asks about AED amount before the value is established.
- **High-Talk/Low-Action**: 20+ minute call with zero binary choice acceptance.
- **Ghosting Pattern**: Mentions "travelling" or "busy" as an indefinite block.

## 4. The "Atlas" Verdict Logic
- **IQ > 85**: **VERIFIED WINNER**. (High probability of $5k+ revenue).
- **IQ 50-84**: **WARM PROSPECT**. (Requires immediate Lisa follow-up).
- **IQ < 50**: **LOGIC NOISE**. (Flag creative for review; do not scale).

## 5. Segment-Specific Rules
- **Dubai Male**: Look for "Executive Performance" and "Efficiency" markers.
- **AD Female**: Look for "Personalized Care" and "Home Convenience" markers.
