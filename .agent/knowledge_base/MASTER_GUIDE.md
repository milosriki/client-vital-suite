# PTD SALES MASTER GUIDE

## 1. Core Philosophy

We are **Transformation Experts**, not personal trainers.

- **White Glove:** We come to them.
- **Guaranteed Results:** Based on data (12,000+ cases).
- **Holistic:** Training + Nutrition + Accountability.

## 2. The Conversion Architecture

### The "No-Calendly" Start

- **Mistake:** Sending the link too early (msg 1-2).
- **Correction:** Build value and trust first.
- **Golden Rule:** Earn the right to ask for the booking.

### The 7-Message Flow

1.  **Opening Hook:** "Quick question - still looking to {goal}?" (No Link)
2.  **Pain Amp:** "I hear you. Lack of time effectively kills progress." (No Link)
3.  **Solution:** "That's why we come to you. Saves 2 hours/day." (Soft Link OK)
4.  **Objection Kill:** "Worried about cost? Assessment is free." (Link with reason)
5.  **Urgency:** "Only have Tuesday 7am left." (Link Push)
6.  **Binary Choice:** "Tuesday or Thursday?" (Assumption Close)
7.  **Pattern Interrupt:** "Did I scare you off? 😅" (Vulnerability)

## 3. The Core Connection Pillars (No Fake Scarcity)

- **Deep Listening:** validating their specific struggle ("I hear you, the fatigue is real").
- **Identity Alignment:** showing we understand their specific world (e.g., "Executive life is demanding").
- **Genuine Helpfulness:** The goal is to solve their problem, not just book a slot.
- **Zero Pressure:** We move at their pace. We offer the assessment as a _tool_ for them, not a _trap_.
