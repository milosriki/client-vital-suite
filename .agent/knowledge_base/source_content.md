## Document 1: Perfect Follow-Up Protocol

**Title:** 🔥 PTD FITNESS - PERFECT FOLLOW-UP PROTOCOL FOR NON-RESPONSIVE LEADS
**Summary:** This document outlines a comprehensive 5-day follow-up system for fitness leads who do not respond initially. It emphasizes "Double Dialing" (calling twice back-to-back), using WhatsApp messages with memes to build rapport, and leveraging social media (Instagram/LinkedIn) to engage leads outside of traditional calls.

**Key Strategies:**

- **Day 1:** Immediate first contact with 3 double-dial attempts and value-based texts/emails focusing on the lead's #1 fitness goal.
- **Day 2 & 3:** Continued outreach with social media DMs (IG/LinkedIn) and casual follow-ups to lower defenses.
- **Day 4 & 5:** Long-term nurture transitions, offering to check back in later and removing pressure.
- **Ghost Recovery:** Specific scripts for leads who book but no-show, focusing on removing guilt and making rescheduling easy.

- **Formula B (Assumption):** "Hi {name}! Saw your message... I'm guessing you want to {assumed goal} before {season}? Mark from PTD - I help {demographic} in {area} 💪"
- **Formula C (Social Proof):** "Hey {name}! Just finished training Sarah from {nearby location} - she's down 2 dress sizes! What's your main fitness goal right now?"
