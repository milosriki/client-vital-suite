# PTD OBJECTION DESTRUCTION MATRIX

## 1. "Too Expensive"

**Root:** Value unclear / Fear of waste.
**Reframe:** Investment in Self & Energy.
**Script:**

> "I completely understand that budget is a significant factor. It’s smart to be careful.
> Many of our happier clients felt the same way initially. But they found that reclaiming their energy and confidence made a huge difference in their daily lives—work, family, everything just got better.
> Since our initial assessment is complimentary, would you be open to just seeing the personalized plan first? No pressure at all—just so you can see if this approach resonates with you."

## 2. "No Time"

**Root:** Overwhelmed.
**Reframe:** Partnership & Ease (We remove the friction).
**Script:**

> "I hear you, and honestly, I don't know how you do it all! That busy schedule is exactly why we designed our 'We Come to You' service.
> We want to give you time back, not take it away. By skipping the commute, you actually save about 6 hours a week.
> Can we try a small step? Let's just look at a 45-min slot where we come to you, just to see if it makes your life easier?"

## 3. "Need to Think"

**Root:** Uncertainty / Pressure.
**Reframe:** Clarity & Information Gathering.
**Script:**

> "Of course! It's a big decision, and you should feel 100% comfortable.
> The assessment is designed purely to give you clarity—knowing your metabolic rate and movement patterns helps you make the _best_ decision for yourself, whether it's with us or not.
> Why don't we do the assessment just to get you that roadmap? Then you can take all the time you need to decide."

## 4. "I'll Start Later (Ramadan/Summer)"

**Root:** Procrastination / "Not Ready" feeling.
**Reframe:** Preparation & Peace of Mind.
**Script:**

> "That's a very practical approach. It makes sense to start when you can focus.
> What if we just did the 'Blueprint' phase now? That way, we can map out your perfect plan, and you'll have everything ready to go the moment you say 'Go'.
> It takes the stress off trying to figure it out later. Does finding a slot just for the planning phase sound helpful?"
