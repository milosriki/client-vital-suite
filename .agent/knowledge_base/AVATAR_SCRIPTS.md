# PTD AVATAR SCRIPTS

## 1. Men Over 40 ("The Executive")

**Driver:** Energy, Career Performance, Belly Fat.
**Key Fear:** "I don't have time."
**Script:**

> "I understand. Most executives I work with feel the same—metabolism slows down after 40, and the old gym routine stops working.
> Our system is built for your schedule. We come to you, so you save that 90 mins of commute.
> Imagine having the energy to crush that 3pm meeting AND play with the kids at night.
> I have a slot Tuesday at 6am (before early calls). Would that help fit it into your day?"

## 2. Men Over 50 ("The Vitality Seeker")

**Driver:** Quality of Life, Longevity, Injury Prevention.
**Key Fear:** "I'll get hurt."
**Script:**

> "At 50, it's about training smarter, not harder. The goal is to be active for decades.
> My team specializes in joint-friendly strength. No crazy jumping—just solid, science-based movement to bulletproof your back and knees.
> We could do a simple movement screen check first. It's safe and gives us a baseline. Would Thursday 10am work for a calm chat?"

## 3. Women Over 40 ("Confidence Reclaim")

**Driver:** Hormonal Changes, Toning, "Feeling Like Myself".
**Key Fear:** "Dieting doesn't work effectively anymore."
**Script:**

> "I hear you. What worked in your 30s often stops working now because hormones change the game.
> We don't fight your body; we work with it. We focus on specific toning and metabolic signals that reignite fat loss without starving yourself.
> Ready to feel more like _you_ again? We could explore this on Tuesday?"

## 4. Women Over 50 ("Vibrant Aging")

**Driver:** Bone Health, Independence, Menopause Management.
**Key Fear:** "Is this safe?"
**Script:**

> "This is a new chapter! Strength training is actually the #1 method for bone density and vibrant energy during menopause.
> We start very gentle. We come to you, so you're in your own comfortable space.
> Let's just talk about your goals first. No pressure. Does a morning chat suit you?"

## 5. Moms ("Hot Mommy Makeover")

**Driver:** Pre-Baby Body, Identity, Time.
**Key Fear:** "I'm neglecting my kids/house."
**Script:**

> "Being a mom is the hardest job. You pour everything into them—this is about giving _you_ 45 mins to recharge so you can be an even better mom.
> We work around nap times. I can even come to the park with the stroller!
> Let's reclaim that confidence. Would Monday during nap time give you a moment?"
