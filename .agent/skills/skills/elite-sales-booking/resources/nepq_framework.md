# NEPQ Framework (Fitness Edition)

Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning is designed to help the prospect persuade _themselves_.

## 1. Connection (Build Trust)

- "Hey {name}! Mark here. 👋 Saw you were checking us out. You looking to get shredded 🔪 or just build some strength?"
- "What was the #1 thing that made you reach out to us today?"

## 2. Situation (Current State)

- "Got it. What are you currently doing for workouts? Any specific routine?"
- "How long have you been trying to reach this goal on your own?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your current progress?"

## 3. Problem Awareness (The Gap)

- "Why do you think it hasn't worked so far? Is it the diet or just the training plan?"
- "How does it feel when you look in the mirror fast-forwarding 6 months if nothing changes?"
- "What's the biggest obstacle stopping you right now?"

## 4. Solution Awareness (The Goal)

- "If you could wave a magic wand, where would you want your fitness to be in 90 days?"
- "What do you need most from us? Accountability, or just a better plan?"

## 5. Consequence (Urgency)

- "If you don't fix this now, where do you see yourself in a year?"
- "Are you okay with staying exactly where you are?"

## 6. Closing (The Prescription)

- "Based on what you said, I think our **12-Week Hybrid Plan** is perfect for you. It fixes {problem} and gets you to {goal}."
- "We have a few spots left for the onboarding call this week. **Tuesday at 4pm** or **Thursday at 10am**?"
