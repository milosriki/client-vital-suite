# GitLens remote workspace access

You can open this repository via GitLens Cloud using the workspace ID below. This is useful if you prefer to inspect commits, branches, and history from within VS Code using the GitLens Remote Explorer.

## Prerequisites
- VS Code with the GitLens extension installed
- A GitLens account (free) signed in inside VS Code

## Connect steps
1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette and run: **GitLens: Open Remote Workspace...**
2. When prompted for the workspace ID, paste: `dbcfff91-ceb2-4390-9949-c53c7689c8ab`.
3. Choose **Open** to load the workspace in the GitLens Remote Explorer. You can then browse files, commits, and branches directly from the cloud workspace.

If you are already connected and need to switch, use **GitLens: Switch Remote Workspace** and enter the same ID.

## Connection status
This repository cannot initiate the GitLens connection itself; the steps above must be run from your VS Code environment. To confirm you are connected, open the GitLens **Remote Explorer** panel and verify that the workspace ID displayed is `dbcfff91-ceb2-4390-9949-c53c7689c8ab`.
