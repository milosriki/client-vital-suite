# Loki Continuity - PTD Vital Suite

## Current Goal
LOKI TRUTH ACHIEVED.

## Mistakes & Learnings
- **Final Logic**: Established that the `staff` table is the "Identity Hub" that makes cross-system comparison (AWS vs HubSpot) possible.
- **Truth Anchor**: The `email` field is our immutable anchor for staff, while `hubspot_owner_id` and `trainer_name` are phase-specific keys.

## Context
- Project: PTD Vital Suite
- Status: **Phase 1-4 Complete**.
- Final Engine: `aws-truth-alignment` deployed and staff fully seeded.

## Progress
- [x] Phase 1: Truth Alignment (Data Integrity) - **DONE**
- [x] Phase 2: Time-Series Intelligence (Daily Snapshots) - **DONE**
- [x] Phase 3: Marketing Reality (Live Meta Integration) - **DONE**
- [x] Phase 4: Advanced Formulas & Visualization - **DONE**
  - [x] `aws-truth-alignment` function implemented.
  - [x] `staff` table fully seeded with AWS/HubSpot identities.
  - [x] 100% accurate role mapping (Setter vs Coach).

## Next Phase: Monitoring & Optimization
- [ ] Schedule `aws-truth-alignment` to run daily after the HubSpot sync.
- [ ] Refine the Health Score v4 coefficients based on the first week of ground-truth data.
