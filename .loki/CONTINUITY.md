# Loki Continuity - PTD Vital Suite

## Current Goal
Implement the Ground Truth Comparison Engine (AWS + HubSpot + Stripe + CallGear).

## Mistakes & Learnings
- **Multi-Source Complexity**: Learned that CallGear drives Setter assignment if unassigned.
- **Financial Forensics**: Stripe data is already being used for advanced fraud detection (Structuring/Ghost Protocol).
- **Attribution Flow**: AnyTrack provides the "First Touch" truth while HubSpot provides the "Sale" truth.

## Context
- Project: PTD Vital Suite
- Ecosystem: Fully mapped (HubSpot, AWS RDS, Stripe, CallGear, AnyTrack, Meta).
- Goal: 100% accurate health scores and coach performance metrics.

## Progress
- [x] Phase 1: Truth Alignment (Data Integrity)
- [x] Phase 2: Time-Series Intelligence (Verified)
- [x] Phase 3: Marketing Reality (Verified)
- [x] Phase 4: Advanced Formulas & Visualization
  - [x] Corrected Matthew Twigg role (Setter).

## Next Phase: The Final Truth Engine
- [ ] Implement `aws-truth-alignment` function.

- [ ] Calculate "True CPA" (Facebook Spend / AWS Completed Assessments).
- [ ] Link every Client to their actual Ongoing Trainer (AWS master).
