# Loki Continuity - PTD Vital Suite

## Current Goal
Execute Phase 5: UI/UX Perfection using Power UI Design System.

## Mistakes & Learnings
- **Design Alignment**: Realized that generic dashboards reduce the "High-Status" perception. Switching to an OLED Dark theme with technical fonts (Fira Code) to match the Antigravity philosophy.
- **Data Visualization**: AWS session frequency must be the central "Hero" metric in the client UI.

## Context
- Project: PTD Vital Suite
- Design System: **PTD High-End Executive** (OLED Dark, Amber/Violet accents, Fira Typography).
- Focus: `ReconciliationDashboard`, `ExecutiveDashboard`, `MarketingIntelligence`.

## Progress
- [x] Phase 1-4: Data Integration & Backend Intelligence - **COMPLETE**
- [x] UI/UX Pro Max: Design System generated and locked.
- [x] Codebase Fix: `design_system.py` syntax error resolved.

## Next Phase: The "Max Dashboard" Refactor
- [ ] Refactor `ReconciliationDashboard.tsx` with OLED Dark style.
- [ ] Implement `MarketingIntelligence.tsx` with Ad Creative visual support.
- [ ] Update `ExecutiveDashboard.tsx` with Daily Briefing and Proactive Alerts.
- [ ] Standardize Fira Typography across all 20+ dashboards.
