Here's the summary:\n\n**Efficiency Report** (8 issues identified):\n\n1. **ClientTable.tsx - Unmemoized Sorting (HIGH IMPACT)** - Fixed in PR\n2. Dashboard.tsx - Multiple separate API calls that could be batched\n3. useClientHealthScores.ts - Sequential database calls\n4. TickerFeed.tsx - Array duplication for animation\n5. ClientRiskMatrix.tsx - Helper functions recreated on every render\n6. Navigation.tsx - Static arrays recreated on render\n7. KanbanBoard.tsx - Calculations inside render loop\n8. LiveActivityFeed.tsx - Object creation in function\n\n**PR Created:** https://github.com/milosriki/client-vital-suite/pull/50\n\nThe fix adds `useMemo` to the client table sorting operation, preventing the O(n log n) sort from running on every render (e.g., when pagination changes). CI checks have passed.\n\nThe full report is available locally at `/home/ubuntu/repos/client-vital-suite/EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md` if you'd like me to share it. You can leave comments directly on the PR for any changes.\n\nATTACHMENT:\"https://app.devin.ai/attachments/3e57773d-e34f-4838-b8b2-16299c36dd07/EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md\"","timestamp":"2025-12-16T23:06:13.129552+00:00","username":null,"origin":null,"user_id":null}]}
